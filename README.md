# HBNB Project

## Intro
This project was completed as part of my training at Holberton School in 2025. 
It aimed to have us work in teams to create a simplified clone of Airbnb, initially named HBnB and later rebranded as Airbnbear.
Beyond the technical aspects, this project helped us learn to collaborate effectively, communicate, and use Git and GitHub for file sharing and version control.

## Part 1 : UML
The aim of this part is to create detailed technical documentation with UML diagrams for the HBnB application, covering the architecture, business logic and system interactions.

## Part 2 : BM & API
The aim of this part is to implement the business logic and APIs of the HBnB application using Python and Flask, creating classes and endpoints to manage users, locations, reviews and amenities, while following best practice in RESTFUL API design.

## Part 3 : Auth & API
The aim of this part is to integrate JWT authentication and SQLite/MySQL database management into the HBnB application to secure the APIs and ensure data persistence, while preparing the application for deployment with a web interface.

You will find this part of the project in folder "Part 3" on this github.

## Part 4 : 
The aim of this part is to develop an interactive web interface for the HBnB Evolution application using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript ES6, connecting the front-end to the back-end services.

This part of the project was completed individually, allowing for more creative freedom in the site's design. Given my username, I decided to rebrand HBnB as Airbnbear, giving it a fresh identity.
